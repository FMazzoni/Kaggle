# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster


This is my first submission for Kaggle Competitions which I placed in the top $15$ % ($2,279/15,254$) with an submission accuracy score of $78$ %.

Performing analysis on this Classic Titanic Dataset required:
- EDA on the different given feature sets
- Separating out the numerical and categorical features
- Understanding the correlations between different feature sets
- Creating new feature sets by extracting relevant information
- Imputation of data
- Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, and Target Encoding feature sets
- Normalizing and preparing Dataset for ML
- Applying Common ML methods to the dataset including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines
  - K-Nearest Neighbor 
  - Naive Bayes
  - Stochastic Gradient Decent
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest


Here you can see the validation accuracies ordered by best score:
